This minimal example showcases the `Random()` function from SIMLIB returning 1.

This happens after 113720 iterations with a starting seed of 754494563.

The last working seed before the broken one is 163364931. The next seed comes out as 2147483647 (`MAXLONGINT`), therefore generating the number 1.
